 * Decides what "home" means for whoever just signed in.
 *
 * Only delivery partners are sent elsewhere: their day is a list of runs and
 * a seed catalogue is no use to them. Admins and managers get the farmer home
 * like everyone else, and reach their tools from the sidebar.
 *
 * An earlier version redirected staff to /staff-accounts too, which quietly
 * trapped them — the sidebar's "Overview" points at "/", so every attempt to
 * reach the farmer app bounced straight back to the staff screen. Sending a
 * role away from the one route that means "home" is a cage, not a shortcut.
